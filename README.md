### Additional requirements <a name="installation"></a>

There are no unusual requirements for running the project files. Further information can be found in the requirements.txt file.


### Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

Out of the choices given by Udacity for the Capstone Project related to the Data Science Nano Degree, I was most interested in the Starbucks data set. I find personal data to be a valuable asset, both for businesses and individuals. In this project, I wanted to learn firsthand how much a company is able to assess individual customers and their behavior based on a small amount of personal data.


### Project(-file) Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

This repository contains the only a small amount of files in the following structure structure:

1. data -> containes all files related to data used
    - data/data_clean.csv -> after data cleaning and wrangling the data is stored in this file to be further used for plots
    - data/portfolio.json -> original dataset
    - data/profile.json -> original dataset
    - data/transcript.json -> original dataset
    - data/Starbucks.jpg -> Image for blog post
2. output -> stores all charts and plots produced
3. Plot.py -> This python file contains all the necessary code to produce the charts used in the blog post on medium.
4. Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb -> Jupyter Notebook that contains all the code for cleaning the data, analyzing it, buidling a dataset for training a model and assessing it.
5. requirements.txt -> includes all installed libraries in the anaconda distributions used for completing this project.
6. README.md


### Results<a name="results"></a>

All findings and conclusions are listed and discussed in this [Medium article](https://medium.com/@d.hutcheson/starbucks-capstone-project-253dc7a6b84). The code and all files necessary are available on my [Github](https://github.com/Daniel-Hutcheson/starbucks_capstone_project).


### Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

There is no licensing for the code in this repository, anyone can use it however they want. Following entities/authors I want to give credit for supplying the necessary data, a rough blueprint for this project and somehow inspiration:
- Udacity and their Data Science Nanodegree, which supplied me with the necessary knowledge to tackle this task. -> [Link](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025)
- Starbucks Coffee Company, for working out an interesting and motivating capstone project for this course and supplying the students with all relevant data. -> [Link](https://www.starbucks.com/about-us/)
